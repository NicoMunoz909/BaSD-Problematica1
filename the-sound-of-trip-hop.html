                        The definition of “trip-hop” is a slippery one; even one of the genre’s pioneers
                        has trouble pinning it down. “Essentially, it needs to have a down-tempo beat,
                        to be hypnotic and narcotic to an extent—that chilled-out, slowed down feeling,”
                        says 
                        <a href="https://sneakerpimps.bandcamp.com/music" class="link2">

                        ’s Liam Howe, whose album
                        <a href="https://sneakerpimps.bandcamp.com/album/becoming-x" class="link2">
                            Becoming X
                        </a>
                        was one of the genre’s foundational LPs. “It also has to have a little bit of dub,
                        a bit of funk, soul, and jazz. We put quite a lot of guitars and folk music into it
                        as well, and if you push genres like hip-hop and jazz as far as they can go,
                        then you come up with a new amalgamation of sound.”

                        That “new amalgamation of sound” first began taking shape in the early ‘90s.
                        Massive Attack’s 1991 album Blue Lines is considered the origin point of the genre,
                        a blueprint for how to blend hip-hop, synth, and dub into a commercial product.
                        Portishead’s Dummy arrived three years later, and immediately became the dinner
                        party album for the cool set, introducing the world to the gorgeous, ghostly vocals
                        of Beth Gibbons. Now, some 20 years later, traces of the genre can be heard in the
                        music of FKA Twigs,

                        Pimps themselves have ended a two-decade hiatus, returning with their fourth studio
                        album,

                            Squaring the Circle
                        </a>. And though it’s primarily associated with the UK, these days there are more
                        than a few notable international acts mining trip-hop to inform their own sound.

                        The Sneaker Pimps’s most iconic album, Becoming X, helped to solidify the UK trip-hop
                        sound. Released in 1996, the album featured the seductive croon of
                        <a href="https://kelliali.bandcamp.com/" class="link2">
                            Kelli Ali
                        </a>
                        , and breakout hits “6 Underground” and “Spin Spin Sugar” combined dreamy electronica
                        beats with crackling vinyl samples and layers of acoustic guitar and keyboards.
                        Ali departed after this album, but founding members Chris Corner and Liam Howe
                        pressed on, with Corner assuming vocal duties on the two albums that followed.

                        “When we were starting to make music in the early ‘90s, we were making instrumental
                        dance music, and there was a similar scene in London,” says Howe, who in addition
                        to his role in Sneaker Pimps has also produced tracks for

                        </a>
                        ,

                        </a>
                        , and

                        . “We were about three-quarters of the way through writing Becoming X when Portishead’s
                         Dummy came out, and that’s when the defining term ‘trip-hop’ landed. We used to call it
                         ‘head music’ before that.” As its title suggests, the group’s fourth album Squaring the
                         Circle is a return to their musical beginnings. “The new album has one foot in that ‘90s
                         trip-hop era, because that’s part of our DNA, [but it’s also] a mixture of Becoming X,
                         Splinter, and Blood Sport. It’s the same band, doing the same thing that we always did.”

                        Former lead singer of Sneaker Pimps, Kelli Ali’s most recent album is the
                        soundtrack to the film
                        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8142690/" class="link2">

                        (2021), which she wrote, produced, and directed. It’s a glimmering, romantic beast
                        of a record, full of skittering percussion, operatic harmonies, and gothic
                        melodrama; songs like “Fade To Black” and “Waiting For Grace” are sweetly
                        melancholy, and the tone  is appropriately cinematic throughout, employing
                        both jazzy brass and, on tracks like “The Fear of London,” video game-style synths.
                        Howe contributed extensively to the mix and production, a throwback to their days
                        working together in Sneaker Pimps. “I’ve always kept in touch with Kelli, she’s
                        lovely,” he says. “She’s got fantastic character to her voice—it’s perfect for a
                        soundtrack. In trip-hop, there was so much influence from ‘60s and ‘70s film
                        soundtracks, and that noir, cinematic sound is a great fit for her voice.”

                        her music and her public presence to address prejudice against Muslims in
                        Western countries. Her 2017 track “

                        .; it was the first song she’d performed entirely in Persian. Her 2020 album
                        Shabrang (a Farsi phrase that loosely translates to mean “night color”), is
                        both malevolent and powerfully feminine. Bone-chilling strings, snarling beats,
                        and futuristic urban club sounds lay the groundwork for her compelling voice.
                        She sounds bereft on Farsi ballad “Gole Bi Goldoon,” fierce on “Darkest Hour,”
                        and vulnerable over the slow clash of piano and softly clattering drums on
                        “All Rivers At Once.”

                        Los Angeles’s Emily Harper Scott and her partner and co-producer Drew Scott
                        make the sort of fuzzy, spacious electronica that invites listeners to disappear
                        inside the warmth of their sound. CYGNUS, released in 2019, is a showcase for
                        Harper’s dexterous range, and her instincts for when to dial up the vocal
                        dramatics and when to leave just aching silence. Her improvisational approach
                        to songwriting on CYGNUS has roots in jazz and R&B—though the glitchy beats,
                        gothic instrumentals, and surreal atmosphere are all signature trip-hop.
