# RR COURSES - BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER 2021 - WEEK 1 & 2
Welcome to my repo with my solutions to week 1 and 2 problems.
## Description
### 1st Week
Copy the HTML structure from a new of my choosing

Here's the new I chose: [Donato Dozzy returns to Tresor Records with new EP, 124](https://ra.co/news/76038)

The file for this project is index.html
### 2nd Week
Copy not only HTML structure but also CSS from a diferent new and try to make a pixel perfect copy, it must be from another newspaper also. Then apply the same style to the new from week 1 to make it look as if they were from the same newspaper

Here's the new I chose: [The Sound of Trip-Hop, Past and Present](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/modern-trip-hop-list)

The file for this project is the-sound-of-trip-hop.html and style.css
## Getting Started
You can either download this repo and open the html files on your browser, or you can take a look at them on Github Pages üëá

## Notes
* I'm lacking the Agipo font used in the original page, so I used Sans-Serif.
* Some interactions can only be achieved with JS (Like navbar only appearing when scrolling up).
* I cut out part of the new because it was too long and it didn't add any new element.
* Not pixel perfect obviously... Pretty close still üòÑ
